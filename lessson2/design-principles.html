                Hick's Law (or the Hick-Hyman Law) states that the more choices a person is presented with, the longer \
                the person will take to reach a decision. Named after psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman, \
                Hick's Law finds frequent application in user experience (UX) design—namely, to avoid overwhelming users\
                with too many choices, thereby keeping them engaged. Instagram is one of the most used apps in the world \
                where users can upload content in the form of pictures, videos, gifs, worded articles and so on. In the \
                app any user has 3 major choices with respect to the content they see — Like it, Comment on it and Share \
                it. The Like function is what is known as the “Double Tap” where one has to double tap the picture and the\
                red heart appears. The app has manifested the art of 'liking' by providing this choice of double tap — \
                no confusions or clutters. You see a picture or a video, you either double tap it or not. Although Facebook \
                does have the same buttons under a picture, you do not see people going crazy over likes as much as you see \
                on Instagram. This is essentially because the choice has been made so simple (double tap) that the reaction \
                time is within seconds after looking at the information. If you notice any user of Instagram, they are all \
                about the speed — “scroll — scroll — double tap — scroll”. The clarity of the user's intended behavior is \
                very obvious.

            <h3>Fitts' Law</h3>
            <p id="fitts">KFC</p>

            <p>
                Fitts' law states that the amount of time required for a person to move a pointer (e.g., mouse cursor) \
                to a target area is a function of the distance to the target divided by the size of the target. Thus, \
                the longer the distance and the smaller the target's size, the longer it takes. The KFC menu is a good \
                example of how one finds it relativley easy to find and select icon on the menu.

                Visual hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance. Designers \
                structure visual characteristics—e.g., menu icons—so users can understand information easily. By laying \
                out elements logically and strategically, designers influence users' perceptions and guide them to \
                desired actions. On Canva, the site uses a visual heirarchy that drives the user to be notice that they \
                need to create an account and begin creating their designs with additional benefits if they have a premium \
                account.
